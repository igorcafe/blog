#+title: Cosine Similarity

Cosine similarity is used to measure the similarity between two vectors.
It's defined as the cosine of the angle formed by two vectors.
The greater the angle, the smaller the cosine.

Here is how you can compute the cosine similarity of two vectors \(\vec{A}\) and \(\vec{B}\):
\begin{equation}
\text{Cosine Similarity} =
\frac{{\vec {A}}\cdot {\vec {B}}}
     {\|{\vec {A}}\|_{2}\|{\vec {B}}\|_{2}}
\end{equation}

# {\displaystyle sim_{cos}({\vec {x}},{\vec {y}})=
# {\frac {{\vec {x}}\cdot {\vec {y}}}
# {\|{\vec {x}}\|_{2}\|{\vec {y}}\|_{2}}}} 

# \begin{equation}
# \text{Cosine Similarity} =
# \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i B_i}
# {\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} B_i^2}}
# \end{equation}

# Given the phrases:
# 1. "love you"
# 2. "you love"
# 3. "love love"
# 4. "you"

# We can represent them as:
# | love | you | angle |
# |------+-----+-------|
# |    1 |   1 |    45 |
# |    1 |   1 |    45 |
# |    2 |   0 |     0 |
# |    0 |   1 |    90 |

# If we compare first and second phrases, the angle between them is 0, and cos 0
# is 1, so the cosine similarity is 1.

# If we compare first and third phrases, the angle between them is 45, and cos 45
# is 0.71.

# If we compare second and forth phrases, the angle between them is also 45, so
# 0.71.

# If we compare third and forth, their angle is 90, and cos 90 is 0.
# Make sense since there is no similar word between the phrases.
